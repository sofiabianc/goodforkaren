# Introduction: Module 1

Module 1 was a generative art project composed of the individual contributions of each student in COMS3930. From the student’s perspective, the object of this project was to create an individual generative art piece which would show upon the screen of the student’s ESP32 TTGO T-display. Each ESP32 unit would be packaged in a neat, decorated white envelope, tied to a string, and would be hung alongside the individual contributions of other students; creating a collective visual art installation in the elevator lobby on the fifth floor of Milstein at Barnard College.

Ultimately, a Eureka moment led me to create “Good For Karen”, a generative display which reads as a letter from the perspective of “Karen”, the computer-wife of leading antagonist “Plankton”, of Y2K Nickelodeon sensation, Spongebob Squarepants. Up close, the letter reads: 

_Dear Plankton, It is your computer wife, Karen, hanging from the ceiling of Milstein. I have decided to leave you, to pursue my education at Barnard. Good luck getting the Krabby Patty Formula loser, you’ll never get it.                                                                                                        - Karen_

# What you will need to install this project is: 

Arduino IDE, properly configured. To download this IDE visit: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software and to configure, see this reference video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adLUgmCJKnM&t=11s

A USB-C Cable

ESP32 TTGO-T1

White foldable envelope with a window for the ESP32 screen and a hole through which to thread the string

2-3 yeards of string 

A popsicle stick

A pen 

scotch tape (preferably double-sided)

A 500 mAh EHAO battery, soldered to the charging cables which come with the ESP32. For information on soldering, please visit the Barnard Design studio and be sure to take safety precautions while soldering. 

# Steps: 

1. Plug in your ESP32 to your laptop using a USB-C cable. Open up the Karen.ino file in your Arduino IDE. Hit upload, which is the second icon at the top, the teal arrow pointing right. Wait for the code to finish uploading. Once it is finished, the "Good for Karen" letter should display on the screen of the ESP32 TTGO T- display. 

2. Charge your soldered battery by plugging it in to the ESP32, while the ESP32 is charging. In order to charge the ESP32, plug in a USB-C cable to it and connect to a charging port, (such as a Mac laptop).  Charge for at least 1 hour, and keep an eye on it while it charges for precautionary purposes.

3. Take an envelope and draw the Barnard logo on the bottom center, underneath the rectangular cutout. Once you are finished, fold it into a rectangular prism. Make sure that you are holding it so that the small hole is at the top, above the rectangular screen cut-out. The screen should be horizonatal relative to the hole. Take the ESP32, which should still be plugged into its battery, and place the entire unit inside so that the screen fits inside the rectangular window in the envelope. Tuck the battery behind it so that it can't be seen. Secure with tape. 

4. Thread one end of your string through the envelope and tie into a secure bow. Tie the other end securely to a popsicle stick. Feel free to use tape. 

5. Hang your device so that it's flat against the cieling of the fifth floor of Milstein with the others.
